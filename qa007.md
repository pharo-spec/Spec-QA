# QA7: how to add dynamically a layout to another layout?

## Question

Hey, does someone have a solution for adding a SpBoxLayout to another layout? I want to expand my UI with a button but self layout add: self createExpandingLayout  like in the spec2 demo gives me the error that SpBoxLayout does not understand #owner so it looks like only SpPresenters can be added that way (createExpandingLayout returns a new SpBoxLayout) 


## Answer

While you can nest layouts and you can add/remove presenters dynamically, that property does not transmit to layouts (you cannot add them dynamically).
Your solution is simply to add a presenter with the layout you want e.g.

```Smalltalk
self layout: SpBoxLayout newVertical.

self layout add: (self newPresenter
  layout: (SpBoxLayout newHorizontal
    add: (self newLabel label: 'I just nested the layout');
    yourself);
  yourself).
```

is a little bit more verbose but at the end, the result is the same
